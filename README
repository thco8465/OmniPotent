 Instructions: 
 - navigate to test/newFrontEnd directory 
 - type "npm run dev" to compile front end vue 
 - Open another terminal and then from omnipotent directory
 - type "node ./server/node.js" to run backend 
 Extra: 
 - Since postgres is run locally on my computer, navigating to the datebase folder and modifying the .env file to send the data to your own 
 postgres user is what I would advise but this is unnecessary to run the application and get a general understanding of the project
